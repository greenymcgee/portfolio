## Open Todos

| # | Summary | Impact |
|---|---------|--------|
| T16 | ~~Re-assess partial unique index on Post.title~~ | Resolved → D23 |
| T17 | ~~Relax UpdatePostDto — description and content are optional for autosave~~ | Resolved → D26 |
| T18 | ~~Restructure rollout — defer /posts/new deletion; move rename + modal earlier~~ | Resolved → D24 |
| T19 | ~~Description modal — manual Save button instead of autosave on close~~ | Resolved → D27 |
| T20 | ~~Move unpublished filter earlier in rollout (after migration, not last)~~ | Resolved → D24 |
| ~~T21~~ | ~~Revise `useAutoSave` call-site plan~~ | Resolved → D31 |
| T22 | ~~404 handling for the edit page~~ | Resolved → D35 (absorbed into PR 14) |
| T23 | Breadcrumbs for `/posts/[id]` and `/posts/[id]/edit` | Cancelled → D38 |
| T24 | Conditional `<SiteNavbar />` — hidden on login + post pages; `<AdminMenuDialog />` still shown | Open — needs decision |
| T28 | Revisit architecture + Jira tickets once pending designs land | Open — blocked on design (see `inputs/design-pending.md`) |
| T25 | ~~Skeleton and error states for edit page~~ | Resolved → D35 (split → PR 14 error handling, PR 15 skeleton deferred) |
| T26 | Skeleton component install (`npx shadcn add skeleton`) + implementation-time discovery | Open |
| T27 | Document `EditPostContent` form state wrapper — component boundaries, prop contracts, `cancelDebounce` threading | Open |
