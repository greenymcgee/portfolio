## Open Todos

| # | Summary | Impact |
|---|---------|--------|
| T16 | ~~Re-assess partial unique index on Post.title~~ | Resolved → D23 |

| T18 | ~~Restructure rollout — defer /posts/new deletion; move rename + modal earlier~~ | Resolved → D24 |
| T19 | ~~Description modal — manual Save button instead of autosave on close~~ | Resolved → D27 |
